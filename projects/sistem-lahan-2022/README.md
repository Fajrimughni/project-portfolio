# 🌱 Eastern Indonesia Land System – BIG 2022

**Project Description:**

This project is part of the **Geospatial Information Agency (BIG)** initiative in 2022 to **update the Land System data in Eastern Indonesia**. It was carried out through an **interdisciplinary approach**, involving **soil science, geography, and geology**, to produce more accurate and useful baseline spatial data for sustainable development planning and natural resource governance.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Update and enrich the land system database, including physiographic units, soil types, land cover, and landforms  
- Integrate geospatial, geomorphological, and regional geological perspectives  
- Provide integrated land information relevant to national policy, especially for Eastern Indonesia

---

## 📦 Folder Contents

- **Summary of methods & evaluation results** – Description of methodology and land system classification  
- **Visual previews** – Visual previews such as thumbnails, land unit sketches, or composite maps  
- **Link to complete spatial dataset** – Links to complete data hosted in cloud storage

---

## 🔍 Interdisciplinary Approach

This project combines complementary scientific disciplines:

- **Soil Science** – Identification of soil types, textures, and agronomic classification  
- **Physical Geography** – Analysis of land cover, morphology, and actual land use  
- **Geology** – Compilation of rock units, geological structures, and origin-based landforms  
- **Remote Sensing & GIS** – For spatial data integration and visualization
