# 🗺️ RTRW Evaluation of Kulon Progo Regency – PATGTL 2022

**Description:**

This project was part of the **Data Collection and Management for the Evaluation of Regional Spatial Plans (RTRW)** in **Kulon Progo Regency** in 2022. The primary focus was conducting **land suitability analysis** to support the review and revision of the RTRW document, using a **Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE)** approach integrated with the **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)** method.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Collect thematic and spatial data relevant to spatial planning evaluation  
- Analyze land suitability for various functions (cultivation, conservation, settlement, etc.)  
- Apply the SMCE-AHP method to support spatial planning decision-making  
- Provide a technocratic foundation for RTRW revision in Kulon Progo Regency

## 🔍 Methodological Approach

The **SMCE** method was used to systematically structure spatial assessment layers, with criteria weighted using the **AHP** method based on expert input and local stakeholder consultations. Key indicators included:  
- Slope gradient  
- Soil type  
- Proximity to major roads and service centers  
- Protected areas  
- Compatibility of actual land use with the existing RTRW
